<h2><B>ABOUT ME</h2></B>
<p><b>ALT SCHOOL ID: ALT/SOE/024/0058</b></p>
<section>
 <p>I am Okwuora Michael Chukwuemeka, a dedicated and efficient time manager with a passion for teamwork. By day, I work at AB Microfinance Bank, and by night, I'm a diploma student at ALT School Africa's School of Engineering, Cloud Engineering Track.
    When I am not working or studying, you can find me on the football field or basketball court, or simply enjoying the great outdoors. I'm a nature lover and sports enthusiast who believes in staying active and connected with the world around me.
    I am also an avid reader and writer, always curious about the latest technology trends and innovations. My goal-oriented mindset drives me to thrive on challenges and continuously improve myself.
